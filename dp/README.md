## Stairs Climbing

Page 1: You can climb 1 or 2 stairs with one step. How many different ways can you climb n stairs?

<a name="cutting-rods"/>

## Cutting Rods

Page 3: Given a rod of length n and preces P[i] for i = 1, ..., n, where P[i] is the price of a rod of length i. Find the maximum total revenue you can make by cutting and selling the rod. (Assume no cost for cutting the rod).

## House Robber

Page 5: You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent house have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into in the same night.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

## Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

Page 8: Say you have an array for which the i.th element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (ie. buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

<a name="maximum-length-of-pair-chain"/>

## Maximum Length of Pair Chain

Page 10: You are given n pairs of numbers. In every pair, the first number is always smaller than the second number.

Now, we define a pair (c,d) can follow another pair (a,b) if and only if b < c. Chain of pairs can be formed in this fashion.

<a name="knapsack"/>

## 0/1 Knapsack

Page 13: A set of n items, where item i has weight w[i] and value v[i], and a knapsack with capacity W.

Suppose to pick a "few" elements from the n elements such that their weight is less or equal to W, but their summed value is maximized.

<a name="longest-common-subsequence"/>

## Longest Common Subsequence

Page 15: Given two sequeneces X[1..m] and Y[1..n], find the longst common subsequence between them.

<a name="longest-common-substring"/>

## Longest Common Substring

Page 18: Given two strings X[1..m] and Y[1..n], find the longst common substring between the two.

<a name="maximum-sum-of-a-contiguous-subarray"/>

## Maximum Sum of a Contiguous Subarray

Page 20: Find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum.
